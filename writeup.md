## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

 Git is the software that fuels GitHub, and GitHub is used to provide refuge to some of the most advanced technologies. I think of it as Git is the Organ System used to keep GitHub alive or Git is the dermis and GitHub is the epidermis.

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing is you manually saving the changes you made to your document, and then pushing is you pushing your work into the repository for others to see your work. It is important because if you dont complete these steps your work won't save and you'll lose your progress and fail.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**

A repository is very similar to a google doc because it is where you put your work, and you are able to share it with others. You can think of it as the study room in a house, since it is for your work.

## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

I believe I am most excited to learn about AIs origins, and what they can offer in the future. I would also like to know more about the coding that goes into place to keep AI up to date. In my head I think of the updates to be like Java when you pull info from websites,but I'm not sure. I am interested in this because I plan to minor in Computer science and I think it's important to learn more about the things that are starting to dominate the space.
