## Reading Comprehension Questions
All answers can be found in the README.md file

**1. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

The main difference I notice is that Git is a VCS while GitHub has an easy to use interface. Git is the software that fuels GitHub, and GitHub is used to provide refuge to some of the most advanced technologies.  

**2. Explain what "committing and pushing" means in your own words. Why are these steps important?**

Committing is you manually saving the changes you made to your document, and then pushing is you pushing your work into the repository for others to see your work. It is important because if you dont complete these steps your work won't save and you'll lose your progress and fail.

**3. What is a repository and what does it contain?**
